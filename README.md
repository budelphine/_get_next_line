# _get_next_line
*The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor.*

**How to use**

â€¢ Compilation will be done this way: 
```gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=32 get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c```

**Result**

- [x] Work with any fd, stdin
- [x] You can define BUFFER_SIZE to read
- [x] Return 0, when found EOF

- [x] Bonuses: work with more than 1 fd in programm
- [x] Bonuses: Use 1 static variable
